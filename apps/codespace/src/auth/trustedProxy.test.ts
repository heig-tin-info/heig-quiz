/**
 * `TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS` → Fastify's `trustProxy` (audit M1 of 2026-09-18,
 * docs/deploy.md § 6).
 *
 * The exam cookie is bound to `request.ip` (analyse.md D5). Behind the Caddy
 * of `deploy/Caddyfile` the portal only ever sees 127.0.0.1, so that binding
 * compares 127.0.0.1 with 127.0.0.1 for everyone and the "same workstation"
 * check can never fire. What is checked here is the whole point of the fix:
 * `request.ip` is the **forwarded** address when the hop is a trusted front
 * end, and the header is ignored when it is not.
 *
 * This is a property of the Fastify setting, not of our own code, and that is
 * exactly why it is worth a test: the setting is one line in `server.ts` and
 * a wrong shape (the boolean, a string instead of a list) fails silently.
