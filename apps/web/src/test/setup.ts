 * Testing Library gives `findBy*` and `waitFor` one second, which assumes a
 * machine running this suite and nothing else. `pnpm -r test` runs four
 * workspaces at once, and under that contention a React Query round trip
 * through a stubbed fetch — resolve, re-render, assert — misses the deadline:
 * TeacherHome's first `findByRole` failed about two runs in three once the
 * command palette suites grew the `dom` project by seventy tests. Nothing is
 * slow on purpose and no query fails to land; only the budget was wrong, and
 * it was wrong before those tests existed, they just made it visible.
 *
 * Five seconds leaves room for a loaded CI runner while keeping a genuinely
 * broken expectation failing promptly.

 * focus contract of Modal, Sheet, the drawers and the confirm dialog would be
 * untestable. Connected elements therefore report 1 px. The cost is that a
 * control hidden by CSS still counts as focusable here; no test relies on
